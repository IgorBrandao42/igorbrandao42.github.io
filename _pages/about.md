I am a first-year Physics Ph.D. student at Yale. I am currently working on Professor Jack Harris' group on magnetically levitating Helium drops and using them as a new platform for optomechanical systems, where a single drop can serve both as an optical resonator and the mechanical oscillator.

I hold a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. in Physics from PUC-Rio. There I did theoretical research on both classical and quantum optomechanics in Guerreiro's Optomechanics Laboratory. In the classical regime, we studied optical levitation on the dark focus of the so-called 'bottle beam'; In the quantum regime, we studied emergence of entanglement between indirectly coupled systems.

Long before I started dwelling into the field of Optomechanics, I did an undergraduate research at IMPA's Fluid Dynamics Laboratory on Scientific Computing, under the advisory of Professor Dan Marchesin. There I developed and implemented a wide range of numerical simulations for their software on Riemann Problems, RPN.

Research Interests
------
Quantum Optomechanics, Quantum Information and Quantum Thermodynamics.

Outside of Physics, I am also interested in numerical simulations in general, from particle trackers to quantum simulators.
