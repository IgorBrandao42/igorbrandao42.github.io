QuGIT
------
The Quantum Gaussian Information Toolbox (QuGIT) is a python numerical toolbox for simulation of quantum Gaussian states and Gaussian dynamics. It utilizes symplectic representation of these states instead of truncated density matrices in order to efficiently simulate multimode Gaussian states and operations. QuGIT provides a wide range of Gaussian operations on arbitrary Gaussian states, including unitaries, partial traces, tensor products, general-dyne measurements, conditional and unconditional dynamics.

For a detailed description of the capabilities of the toolbox and examples of usage, please refer to: [Computer Physics Communications 280, 108471 (Aug. 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465522001904)
