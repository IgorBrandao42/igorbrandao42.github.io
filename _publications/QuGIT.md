Simulating quantum states on a classical computer is hard, typically requiring prohibitive resources in terms of memory and computational power. Efficient simulation, however, can be achieved for certain classes of quantum states, in particular the so-called Gaussian quantum states of continuous variable systems. In this work we introduce QuGIT - a python numerical toolbox based on symplectic methods specialized in efficiently simulating multimode Gaussian states and operations. QuGIT is exact, requiring no truncation of Hilbert space, and provides a wide range of Gaussian operations on arbitrary Gaussian states, including unitaries, partial traces, tensor products, general-dyne measurements, conditional and unconditional dynamics. To illustrate the toolbox, several examples of usage relevant to quantum optics and optomechanics are described.
